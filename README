How to implement new filters.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a new filter you must create a class that inherits from Filter and a
class that inherits from FilterView.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Filter has three methods that have to be implemented:

AddImage(cv::Mat image) includes in input image to the filter. Many images may
be input, if the filter requires multiple images.

IsApplicable() returns true if the added files are of the right type for
processing.

Apply() executes the processing of the filter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FilterView is a class that deals with input and output of data to and from the
filter.  FilterView has three methods that have to be implemented:

ProcessArgs(std::vector<std::string> arguments) receives a vector of strings
that are passed as the program's arguments for the filter. In this methos you
should expect all parameters necessary and convert them to their correct types.

ProcessInput() is not unlike ProcessArgs, but it is for interactive input, so
you should ask the user for the necessary parameters through standard input.

Output() is where you should implement the output of the filter. Writting the
result in a file, for exemple.

Additionally, you should modify FilterView's protected std::string flag. This
value is the flag associated with the filter recognized in the program's
arguments.
